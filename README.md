## Steps I took to solve this challenge

The first thing I did for this challenge is go through the given
code and highlight any non semantic tags I found by adding comments.

I then practiced the git workflow by pushing those changes to the repo.

Next I researched which semantic elements would be the best fit for
each element I highlighted.

Because of my previous experience with html and css, I altered the css
after changing each tag.
